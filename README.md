# Star-Ratings
Rate Your Favorite (Fake) Bands
I am not sure if the Event Listener for getRatings loads in time 
so the difference in ratings via the Font Awesome stars doesn't work.
See the bottom of the getRatings function; the .style doesn't update the stars after changing a rating.
(Yes I commented it out, but if I put it in for real, it won't work)

 

If you run the code and check the console, the artist names did initially appear, in 5 separate lists with the rating for the current item in the list.
